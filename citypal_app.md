## CityPal

CityPal is an app I helped develop in a group.
The goal was to prototype an application that would recommend local activities based on user's preferences then partner them with someone else interested in that same activity. Explainability and transparency were a focus of design and testing so explanations for the recommendation system are included within the app.
